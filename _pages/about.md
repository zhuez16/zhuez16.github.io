I'm Enzuo Zhu(朱恩佐 in Chinese), a PhD student in computer science at UC Davis, advised by Prof. Caleb Stanford. Previously I'm a master student in computer science at UC Riverside, advised by Prof. Yan Gu and Prof. Yihan Sun. My current research work is about designing parallel algorithms to certain problems, and before that I was working with prof. Cheng Li at University of Science and Technology of China on automated verification skills on fine-grained consistency for my bachelor study. 

My research interests lie in various topics in computer sciences, especially in designing algorithms or solutions to parallel computing, verification, compiler, etc.
